# Build a Bookbot project

Personal solution to the [Build a Bookbot](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot) project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).

## Set up

1. Open your terminal from the project's root directory.
2. Create a sub-directory named `books/`, then create a new file within it named `frankenstein.txt`.
3. Copy the contents of [*Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt) into `books/frankenstein.txt`.
4. Run the main Python script:

    ```python
    python main.py
    ```
